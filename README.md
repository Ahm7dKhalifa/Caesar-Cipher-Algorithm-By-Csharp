# Caesar-Cipher-Algorithm-By-Csharp
 The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet.<br>
 The cipher illustrated here uses a left shift of three, <br />
 so that (for example) each occurrence of E in the plaintext becomes B in the ciphertext.<br />
 In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift
 ,is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. <br />
 It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.<br/>
 For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. <br />
 The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence
